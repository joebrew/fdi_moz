-OPPORTUNITY
Mozabique's recent economic growth has been facilitated by the government's open policy towards foreign investment, a plentiful supply of natural resources (particularly x,y,z) and relatively inexpensive labor. Improvements in health have accompanied economic expansion, but Mozambique still lags behind in basic health indicators, such as a, b, c. Though strong evidence shows that improved health yields substantial economic benefits, private foreign investment has played only a secondary role in malaria prevention and control in recent years, with xx% of malaria-related funding coming from yyy. However, the magnitude of both foreign direct investment and malaria's burden may offer a unique "win-win" for business and public health.
