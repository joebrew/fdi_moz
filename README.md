# Foreign direct invesment, corporate social responsibility and malaria in Mozambique

## What

This project seeks to provide an overview and reflect on the experiences of private firms engaging in privately-funded malaria control activities in Mozambique. Specifically, we explore the benefits of private financing of malaria control interventions, and caution against an overreliance on such an approach from a public health perspective. Additionally, we map out the landscape of private industries, and attempt to identify areas that are ripe for a "scaling-up" of private investment.

## Why

Very little research has been done on (a) the landscape of private investment in Mozambique, and (b) the effect of that investment on health. This project seeks to fill a research gap.

## Who

Joe Brew, Elisa Sicuri, and Celine Aerts.

## Reproduction

### Academic literature

To reproduce the results of the systematic review, follow the search parameters described in the "Academic Literature" sub-section of the "Systematic Review" section of the paper. The bibliography for the results retrieved is at [bibliography.bib](bibliography.bib). Access to both PubMed and EBSCOHost is required.

### Grey literature

Exact reproduction of the "grey literature" section is likely not feasible, due to the rapidly changing nature of internet search databases, as well as the somewhat subjective nature (relative to the academic papers) through which the filtering mechanism was engaged.
