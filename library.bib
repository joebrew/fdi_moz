@article{Bloom2008,
abstract = {Health is a direct source of human welfare and also an instrument for raising income levels. We discuss a number of mechanisms through which health can affect income, focusing on worker productivity, children’s education, savings and investment, and demographic structure. As well as the impact of current illness, health may have large effects on prospective lifespans and life cycle behavior. Studies suggest there may be a large effect of health and nutrition in utero, and in the first few years of life, on physical and cognitive development and economic success as an adult. Macroeconomic evidence for an effect on growth is mixed, with evidence of a large effect in some studies. However, there is a possibility that gains from health may be outweighed by the effect of increased survival on population growth, until a fertility transition occurs. The low cost of some health interventions that have large‐scale effects on population health makes health investments a promising policy tool for growth in developing countries. In addition, higher priority could be given to tackling widespread “neglected” diseases—that is, diseases with low mortality burdens that are not priorities from a pure health perspective, but that do have substantial substantial effects on productivity.},

 abstract = {The literature on the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) and activities of multinational enterprises (MNEs) on host-countries has been almost exclusively focused on issues of productivity, growth and wages.   We argue that this leaves quite a bit of important unexplored areas of inquiry, particularly those connected with the interactions of local communities and governments with MNEs.  As an example, we provide a novel analysis of local corporate philanthropy, which shows significant differences between local- and foreign-owned corporations. We find that foreign-owned enterprises are less likely to give, but that when they do give, it is substantially more in magnitude than domestic firms, everything else equal.  This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that foreign-owned firms would prefer to use corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities on a more international scale, but will strategically use CSR activities for public relation motives when the MNE faces greater local scrutiny and/or bias.},
